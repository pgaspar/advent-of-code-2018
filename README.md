# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2018 (Ruby)

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

My main focus is exploring the problems with an Object Oriented mindset. Performance is an important part of life, but it's not what I'm focusing on here (look [here](https://github.com/petertseng/adventofcode-rb-2018), for example, if it's what you care about).

**This is WIP:** I'm already late in my submissions, so I'll not have everything here by the 25th.

## Running the solutions

```
ruby day_1/run.rb
